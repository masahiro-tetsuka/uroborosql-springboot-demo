## Build Setup

You should install node.js first.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
  
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
  
# build for production with minification
npm run build

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Sever side integration

When running `npm run build`, the built artifacts are deployed in the server side resource folder.
